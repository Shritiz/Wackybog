# 2048 Game

Welcome to the 2048 Game! This is a simple yet addictive puzzle game where the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the 2048 tile.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Slide tiles with the same number together to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.
2. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles in the desired direction.
3. **Combining Tiles**: When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a tile with the number 4.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when there are no more valid moves available.
